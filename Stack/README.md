What is a stack?
A stack is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end. It's ordering technique is called "Last in First Out" (LIFO). When a value is popped, the top of the stack is removed. A new value is added to the top of the stack. Therefore, newer items will remain at the top while the oldest item is at the bottom of the stack.
